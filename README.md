# SeisSol_Cookbook

This is the repository for SeisSol Cookbook (https://seissol.readthedocs.io/). This documentation is a collection of useful simulation examples to help users build dynamic rupture model from the scratch with little efforts. Each example is demonstrated carefully with 1) geometry building, 2) parameter setup, and 3) result visualization. Users are suggested to repeat each example in order to get a comprehensive idea of how to set up dynamic simulation with SeisSol. The updates of source software and news of SeisSol should be posted in SeisSol GitHub (https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol).

For further information on running SeisSol see our [Documentation] (https://seissol.readthedocs.io)
